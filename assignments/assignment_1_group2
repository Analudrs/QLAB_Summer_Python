Database: Young Lives
Information: is a unique longitudinal study of poverty and inequality that has been following the lives of children in 
Ethiopia, India , Peru and Vietnam. 
Interest: I would like to study information of empowerment in the lives of the children from their early years, through adolescence, 
and into young adulthood, especially in the case of women. I think that Young Lives fits with my idea of posible research question
because is a longitudinal study since 2001 and has interesting modules to investigate.
