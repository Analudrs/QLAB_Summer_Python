    "You can and should always ask ChatGPT, BARD, Bing, etc. In this exercise, you will work with financial data. Follow the steps below:\n",

    "1 - Load Data: Load the financial data available at this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/finance-vix/main/data/vix-daily.csv Use pd.read_csv() adn the link to load the data into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Explore Data: a) Display the first five rows of the DataFrame. b) Display the summary statistics of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - Add Columns: a) Add a new column 'Level' that categorizes the 'Close' column values into 'Low' (< 20), 'Medium' (20-30), and 'High' (>30). You need to make a filter to make this categorization. You can see below some suggestions how to do it. b) Add a new column 'Year' extracted from the 'Date' column. You need to work with dates. You can do it directly workiwith the column splitting it or changing it to date format an dfollowing the below suggestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - Add Rows: a) Add a new row with a date of your choice and fill the other columns with appropriate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 - Analysis: a) Calculate the average of the column 'Close' for each 'Year'. You need to group for this task. b) Count the number of 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low' Level days in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions:\n",

    "Use pd.cut() for categorizing 'Close' values.\n",
    "Use pd.to_datetime() and dt.year to extract the year from a date.\n",
