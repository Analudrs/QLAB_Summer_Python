Group 3: database options
Members: Alexander, Christian, Esteban and Brisa

1.	Brisa
a. Database: Multidimensional Deprivation Index (MDI), United States Census Bureau
b. Information: An Index at a county level (county codes) about human deprivation in 6 dimensions: standard of living, education, health, economic security,
   housing quality, and neighborhood quality, from years 2010 to 2019. This an alternative, more comprehensive way of estimating poverty.
c. Interest: I would like to observe the evolution of this indicator across time, and even be able to regroup the cases according to other characteristics,
   like state or geographic zone.
