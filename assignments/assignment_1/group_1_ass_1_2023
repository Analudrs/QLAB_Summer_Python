a. Database: The Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (ELCSA)
b. Information: It is one of the four experience-based food insecurity scales included in the Data4Diets platform, which also contains the Household Hunger Scale (HHS), the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), and the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES).
c. Interest: This scale is based on a form on food security, a subject in which I am interested in delving deeper and seeing its relationship with possible explosions from public policies.
