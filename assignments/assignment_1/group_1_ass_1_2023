a. Database: ECLAC / Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean / Based on data from Household Surveys Database (BADEHOG). 2001-2022.
b. Information: It shows the percentage of the population whose average per capita income is below the poverty and extreme poverty line according to their sex, age and country of living. It has data since 2001 and it keeps being updated.
c. Interest: I am interested on this database because I am willing to understand the intersections that social attributes can have with economical conditions, as well as their shades accross the Latin American nations. As well, I would like to compare these percentages with their corresponding total amount of people (for example, which is the amount of elder women living in poverty compared to the total number of elder women)
