a.Database: ENAHO Module 3 (Education)
b.Information:  The ENAHO Module 3 is a specialized dataset within the National Household Survey (ENAHO) that centres on education-related 
information. It gathers comprehensive data on various aspects of education, encompassing individuals of different age groups and educational 
levels within Peru. The dataset provides a rich source of information, capturing details such as enrollment patterns, academic performance, 
and educational trajectories.
c.Interest: I'm particularly intrigued by the information available in ENAHO Module 3, especially concerning the academic and career choices 
made by the participants. My research focuses on how individuals' chosen career paths correlate with their skill sets and academic 
achievements, and whether there are discernible differences based on factors like the type of secondary school attended (national or private).
