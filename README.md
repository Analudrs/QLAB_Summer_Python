This is a list of songs. 


2. Ximena Pinillos 

Today is the day I'll learn that I believe in miracles
I can feel the world opening up, I think I broke the curse
Now I won't grab you by the arm when you go
No one can give me what I want
Yeah, I know

3. Angie Quispe

I just pretend that I'm in the dark and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you

4. Joaquin 

In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
Someday
Someday
Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay
Sometimes
Sometimes


6. Valeria

One more time
One more time
One more time, we're gonna celebrate

7. Kerly Tito 

지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical, yeah
저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아


6. Valeria

One more time
One more time
One more time, we're gonna celebrate

7. Kerly Tito 

지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical, yeah
저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아
